# main42d05
this contains the main file for d05, just comment out or delete from the main file the tests that you won't need. Move this main.c to your d05-directory mv main.c ../../d05 compile from the top of your directory after doing the previous steps. gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o <test_name> main.c /.c where <test_name> put the name you'd like. if there's a compiling error... sorry. lol. Did the best I could ^_^
