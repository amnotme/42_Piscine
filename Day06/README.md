# main42d06
main file and exercises for d06 are here.
this contains the main file for d06, just comment out or delete from the main file the tests that you won't need. Move this main.c to your d06-directory mv main.c ../../d06 compile from the top of your directory after doing the previous steps. gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o <test_name> main.c /.c where <test_name> put the name you'd like. if there's a compiling error... sorry. lol. Did the best I could ^_^
